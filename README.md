# AI_Final_Project

This is a repository containing an artificial intelligence final project created by myself and Stephen Haugland.  It is a genetic algorithms project written in Python.  The goal was to create artificial sprites that would navigate a maze, reproduce, and learn to improve navigation of the maze in successive generations.
